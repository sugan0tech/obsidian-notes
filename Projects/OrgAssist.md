A Full fledged management suite suitable for kickstarting any organisation like Universities, Schools, and classical work environments. I will have a build in identity access management highly configurable ( a custom integration of keycloak ). Capable of managing attendance ( advanced geo-verify features ), events ( virtual option within app ), analysis tool and formalities management ( permission letters and other official document things ).



## tools planned to have implementations
| Kind | List |
|-- | -- |
|Backend Services | Spring, Go |
| Frontend | React/Htmx |
|protocols | webRTC, gRPC, p2p, GraphQL, WebSocket |
|messenger | kafka |
|DB | postgress, redis and nosql |
| env | DigitalOcean mostly |


## Finalised Stack
| Service | Stack/Language |
|-- | --|
| IAM board | Keycloak |
| Core Service | Spring boot |
| communication stream | Kafka |
| Data Export | go |
| Formalities Service | Spring / go / python |
| Frontend Service | Svelte |
| Api's | REST & ~~gRPC~~ & GraphQL |
| CI/CD | Jenkins & sonarlint api |




## TODO's
- [ ] svelte implementation for the frontend
- [ ] is microservice possible with limited time constrains
- [ ] usablity of Kafka 
- [ ] Workaround on Websockets 
- [ ] Workaround on GraphQL
- [ ] redis needed?
- [ ] Jenkins ( might not be possible to use a cloud suite )
- [ ] Feasablity of local microservice hosting
- [ ] migration of old code base ( Event-Manager )
- [x] use NoSQL datastore for attandance thing



gRPC status
- since no support from the browser side, dropping the gRPC going for websockets and restapis ðŸ˜¥. MIght be usable in complete backend.
