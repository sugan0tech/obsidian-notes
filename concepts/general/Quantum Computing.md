### Preparing for y2q
- As like y2k, then arise quantum computing gave a increasing concerns over security on our standard encryption algorithms.
- With the Moore's law, current encrypting algos will provide a assured time period of 3000 yr, but as with rise of quantum computing that window reduced to next 10yr.
- Surprisingly with the break of enigma code, went public after 30 yrs. We are not sure whether it's already possible or not.
- So it's better to be equipped with post quantum encryption standards as soon as possible.

> This new problem is considered as next form of y2k, which costs about an estimate of 388 billion ( trillions in current standards )

### Shor's Algorithm
- The fundamental reason for the easy break of hash keys, is by shor's algorithm
- Each guess with the provided probablity of 37.5.
- [[Shor's Algorithm]]

> Shor's algorithm is basically a guess generator, but each time the guess become more accurate with the help of qbits
### Initial industries to migrated
- Banking sectors, Cryptos 
- All critical api transactions
- TLS, based on criticality

### Bottle necks on implementing on current hardware
- Algorithmic weightage, i.e requires more resources for it's computation
- Hard to access the timeframe where it can withstand the growing quantum computing space
