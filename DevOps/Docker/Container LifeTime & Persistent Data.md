## üöÄ Immutable Infrastructure
- **Immutable Infrastructure** means only redeploying containers rather than changing them after deployment. This approach ensures **consistency** and **reliability** across environments.
  
> [!info] 
> For applications like databases, which require persistent data storage, Docker provides two main solutions: **Volumes** and **Bind Mounts**.

---

## üìÅ Volumes
- **Definition**: Volumes are managed by Docker and reside outside the container's Union File System (UFS), providing a way to persist data generated and used by Docker containers.

- **Declaration in Dockerfile**: You can define a volume in a Dockerfile with the `VOLUME` instruction:
  
  ```dockerfile
  VOLUME /var/lib/mysql
  ```

- **Storage Location**: When created, Docker manages the volume‚Äôs location on the host system. For example, on a Linux host, it might be located at:
  
  ```bash
  /var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume_id>/_data
  ```
  
  > [!note] 
  > On Windows and macOS, this path is within the Linux VM that Docker uses to run containers.

- **Container Reference**: Inside the container, the volume mounts to the specified path, like:
  
  ```bash
  /var/lib/mysql
  ```

- **Advantages**: Volumes are the recommended approach for **persisting data** across Docker containers. They are more **efficient**, **flexible**, and **manageable** than bind mounts, and they support sharing data among containers.

## üîó Bind Mounts
- **Definition**: Bind mounts link a **host file or directory** directly to a **container path**. This allows the container to access the exact same files as the host.

- **Usage**: Specify bind mounts at runtime using the `-v` or `--mount` flag with `docker run`. For example:

  ```bash
  docker run -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container my-image
  ```

- **Behavior**: Changes to files in the container reflect on the host, and vice versa. This can be helpful for **development environments** where the container should have access to the host‚Äôs files.

  > [!warning]
  > Bind mounts cannot be declared in a Dockerfile and must be specified at runtime, making them less portable than volumes.

## üîç Key Differences
| Aspect          | Volumes                                                       | Bind Mounts                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Management**  | Managed by Docker                                             | Managed by the host system                              |
| **Portability** | More portable across environments                             | Depends on host's directory structure                   |
| **Use Cases**   | Ideal for **production** environments needing persistent data | Useful for **development** with direct host file access |

> [!tip]
> Volumes are generally better for **data persistence** in production environments, while bind mounts are useful in **development and testing**.
