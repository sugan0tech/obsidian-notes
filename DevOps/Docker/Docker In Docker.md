## Running Docker Inside Docker (DinD)

### Why Avoid DinD?

Running Docker inside Docker, while feasible, is generally discouraged due to:

- **Security risks:** Containers running with extended privileges can compromise the host.
- **Complexity:** Managing nested Docker daemons can lead to unnecessary complexity in deployment pipelines.

### Plan to Install Docker in a Bare Ubuntu Container

#### Try 1: Bare Ubuntu Image

1. Start with a base Ubuntu container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --rm ubuntu
   ```
2. Install Docker inside the container:
   ```bash
   apt-get update
   apt-get install -y docker.io
   ```
3. Run a Docker command inside the container:
   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```

- **Result:**
  >[!error]
  > `docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?`

#### Analysis
- The container cannot access the Docker daemon because `/var/run/docker.sock` is inaccessible.
- Starting Docker requires either **mounting the socket** or running **Docker-in-Docker (DinD).**

---

#### Try 2: Using `--privileged` Flag

```bash
docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --privileged --rm -it ubuntu:latest
```

> [!note]
> The `--privileged` flag enables extended capabilities:
> - Disables SELinux process labels.
> - Allows read/write access to `/sys`.
> - Mounts cgroups as read/write.
> - Provides access to all host-mounted devices.
> - Grants all Linux kernel capabilities.
>
>Here it's not mandatory to use privileged flag


- **Result:**
  - Docker commands inside the container work when `docker.sock` is mounted.

#### Table: Comparison of Privileged vs Non-Privileged Containers

| Feature                     | Non-Privileged           | Privileged               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| SELinux restrictions        | Enabled                  | Disabled                 |
| Device access               | Limited                  | Full                     |
| Docker socket accessibility | Requires manual mounting | Requires manual mounting |
| Kernel capabilities         | Limited                  | All granted              |
| Security risks              | Low                      | High                     |

### Alternative Approaches

#### 1. **Docker-in-Docker (DinD)**

Run a separate Docker daemon inside the container:

```bash
docker run --privileged --name dind-container -d docker:dind
```

- Suitable for isolated environments like CI/CD pipelines.
- **Risks:** Privileged mode can expose the host system to vulnerabilities.

### Key Takeaways

>[!note]
> - Use **DooD** for simplicity and avoiding privileged mode.
> - Use **DinD** only for isolated environments (e.g., CI/CD).

>[!warning]
> Be cautious with the `--privileged` flag and mounting `/var/run/docker.sock` due to potential security risks.

>[!info]
> Always evaluate the necessity of running Docker inside a container and explore alternatives like running Docker commands directly on the host.
