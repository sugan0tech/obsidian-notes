>1. Netfilter: The lowest level, making pizza from scratch at home. Requires the most knowledge but gives you the most control.
>2. Iptables: A layer on top of Netfilter. It's like buying a pizza kit that you cook yourself. You have less control, but it's easier to manage.
>3. UFW: Further simplification, similar to ordering a pizza for delivery. You have even less control, but it's even easier to use.
>4. Predefined setups: The simplest option, it's like dining out at a restaurant. You have minimal control, but it's the easiest to use. The 'better' choice depends on your needs and comfort level with managing firewall rules.
