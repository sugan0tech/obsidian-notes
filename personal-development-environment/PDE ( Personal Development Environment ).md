## God tier work flow, fine tuned for my productive endeavours

### How I end up here
> Ever since I found vim, things have change in my dev setup. Trying to find all the possible inclusion of vim bindings when ever possible. This made me come from a windows user with vim ( plug configurations ) to a Arch user who is been using i3wm setup for primary desktop setup.

> So most of the interactive tools will be vim based and configs are fine-tuned for better support with vim bindings.

## So how the workflow will feel like

> Kinda feels like keyboard God, what eve you thing of within this os you can bring it with an ease.

1. if you want to open a applications then do `win + d + [app-name]` whola done
2. If you want to install a tool `yay -S app-name` 8/10 it will be installed with the power of AUR.
3. wanna move between tabs, the comes the use of i3 ( with vim bindings obiviously )
	1. i can move or alter the window arrangements with ease
	2. can make floating widows easily and switching also easy peasy `win + space`
 4. for terminal just `win + enter` boom a [[Alacritty]] terminal with [[nushell]]'s  power will be there in front of you
 5. Guess what you can even use vim bindings with [[Alacritty]] and in the prompt of [[nushell]] as well



## How I maintain the configs
- [repo](https://www.github.com/sugan0tech/config)
- I have a shared `~/.config` as a single maintained repo. just clone and replace it.
